	<div>
		<h2>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h2>
		<p>The software is still in testing phase and should not be used for production environments.<br>
		It is assumed that you have a strong knowledge of Virtualbox and system administration.<br>
		Such topics will not be supported, to allow focus on the Hyperbox software itself.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Hyperbox is designed to be the manager of your virtualized infrastructure, and is best used on a dedicated host where no other tools accessing and/or controlling the hypervisor are running.<br>
		It is composed of 2 parts:
			<ul>
				<li>The Server where all the work take places and which interacts with the hypervisor and abstract out all the details to present a common layer that can be used to manage hybrid environments, e.g. Virtualbox and VMware ESXi.</li>
				<li>The Client which send the user input to the server for processing and allow to interact with the Server and the Hypervisor</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Server</h2>
	<div>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>The server aims to provide centralized user management with authentication, authorization and auditing. This means that a dedicated system user should be used to run the hypervisor - opposite of what Virtualbox does by default per example.<br>
		Keeping this in mind, the following instructions are given for Debian-based systems, prefered OS for Hyperbox.<br>
		If you are using another Linux distro, manual installation can be performed using the zip package, coping the server files to a location of your choice, and installing the init.d script. Note that the init.d script will need minor adjustements.<br>
		If you are using Windows, the installer will copy the server files and install the service. Starting from there, the instructions are the same for configuration and logs review.</p>

	<h2>Client</h2>
	<div>
		<h3>Installation</h3>
		To install the client, simply download its installer and run it. For Debian & Fedora based distributions, run the following :
		<code>sudo sh ./hbox_client-*.run</code>
		For other distros, use the zip package and perform a manual install.<br>
		<p>For Windows, run the installer.</p>
		<p>The Client can then be launched via the Start Menu/Main menu or by creating a shortcut poiting to &#60;INSTALL_DIR&#62;/hyperbox(.exe) and setting the working dir to &#60;INSTALL_DIR&#62;

		<figcaption>
			You will be prompted to enter the hostname/IP address of the server you want to connect to. The Hyperbox Server default listener is available on all interfaces by default.<br>
			The default username / password are : admin / hyperbox<br>
			Click on Save once finished.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<br>
	<figure>

		<figcaption>
			You can now right click > Connect or double-click on the server address to initiate the connection.<br>
			If successful, the icon will change to a stopped server icon, and the tabs on the right panel should activate. You should also see the Hyperbox Server detailed and that is it disconnected of the hypervisor.<br>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

		<figcaption>Right click on the server: Select Hypervisor > Connect</figcaption>

		<figcaption>
			Hyperbox comes by default with two connectors per system :
			<ul>
				<li>Linux-based : Virtualbox WebService 4.2 and Virtualbox XPCOM 4.3</li>
				<li>Windows-based : Virtualbox WebService 4.2 and Virtualbox WebService 4.3</li>
			</ul>
			Select the one matching your installation. You can leave the connection options field blank for now, it is used for advanced configuration.<br>
			Click on Connect.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<figure>
		<img src="gettingStarted_client_server_connected_hyp_connecting.png" />
		<figcaption>You should now see a new task in the bottom list showing you that Hyperbox is currently connecting and initializing the connection with the hypervisor.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<br>
	<figure>
		<img src="gettingStarted_client_server_connected_hyp_connected.png" />
		<figcaption>If successful, the server icon will change as well as the hypervisor status in the detail panel.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<br>
	You can now then manage your machines or create new ones by right clicking on the server list item in the left panel!
