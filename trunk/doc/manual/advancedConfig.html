						Define the maximum loging level for Hyperbox. A level include all the levels above (in terms of verbosity). The following levels are available in increasing verbosity order :<br>
						FatalException - Only log exceptions stack traces that caused the server to stop. This is currently not used.<br>
						Exception - Log exceptions stack traces that are not fatal. This is tightly linked to Error level as each error will also produce an exception entry.<br>
						Error - Log errors that occured. This is tightly linked to Exception level as the message will be the exception message.<br>
						Warning - Log warnings.<br>
						Info - Log regular info messages. This is the default level.<br>
						Verbose - Log precises info messages.<br>
						Debug - Log debug info for each server activity, task and client request: This can be quite verbose and should not be kept on in live environement due to the performance penality.<br>
						Tracking - Log code tracking info: This is very verbose and WILL inflict a high performance penality but will provide very detailed info for debugging.
