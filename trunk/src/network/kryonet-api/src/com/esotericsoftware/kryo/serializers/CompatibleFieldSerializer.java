/** Serializes objects using direct field assignment, with limited support for forward and backward compatibility. Fields can be
 * added or removed without invalidating previously serialized bytes. Note that changing the type of a field is not supported.
 * <p>
 * There is additional overhead compared to {@link FieldSerializer}. A header is output the first time an object of a given type
 * is serialized. The header consists of an int for the number of fields, then a String for each field name. Also, to support
 * skipping the bytes for a field that no longer exists, for each field value an int is written that is the length of the value in
 * bytes.
 * <p>
 * Note that the field data is identified by name. The situation where a super class has a field with the same name as a subclass
 * must be avoided.
