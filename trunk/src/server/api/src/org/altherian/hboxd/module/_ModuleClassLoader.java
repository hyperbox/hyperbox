 * A Module Class Loader is the magic behind the scenes that allow java code to be added, reloaded or removed at runtime without any packages

 * Module ClassLoader will be internally made of a custom implementation of a ClassLoader. For an example, see the Server implementation for the
 * default ModuleClassLoader class.<br/>
 * The Module ClassLoader should scan a base path and all its sub-paths for any java code (typically, in .jar, .zip and .class files) to be able to
 * provide the following essentials services :
 * <ul>
 * <li>Load & unload implementation.
 * <li>Return a Class implementation give its full qualified name (e.g. org.altherian.hboxd.module._ModuleClassLoader) if such class can be found
 * within the module files.</li>
 * <li>Return the set of all found Java code in a Set of URL pointing to the Java files.</li>
 * </ul>
